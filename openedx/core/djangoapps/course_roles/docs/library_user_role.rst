Library User role
#################

Description - Current State
***************************

``library_user`` role
---------------------

* The ``library_user`` role in the ``student_course_access_role`` service is used to **assign access** to a **content library**.
* The **library** is stored as the **"course"** in the data model.

v2 Content Libraries
--------------------

* **v2 Content Libraries** is an **ongoing project** to modernize the content libraries data structures.
* Once **completed**, v2 Content Libraries will **no longer utilize** ``student_course_access_role`` to control access.

``course_role`` data structures
-------------------------------

* The database model for ``course_role`` uses a **foreign key** for the ``course_id`` when assigning a role to a user.
* The foreign key usage means that a **library cannot be** considered a **"course"** for role assignments that utilize ``course_role``.


Potential Options
*****************

Below is a list of options discussed for migrating from ``student_course_access_role`` to ``course_roles`` in regards to the ``library_user`` role.

1. ``library_user`` is not migrated to ``course_roles``.
    * The ``library_user`` role will continue to be used from within the ``student_course_access_role`` service.
    * Once all content libraries have been migrated to v2 content libraries, the ``library_user`` role will no longer be needed.
    * At this time, the final deprecation of ``student_course_access_role`` can occur.

2. A new permissions based service is created for access to non-course objects.
    * Access will initially be for content libraries, but could be expanded to other objects as needed.
    * The set of permissions in the new service will match those created for ``course_roles``.

Option 1 is currently the option that will be implemented,
but a decision will not be finalized until migration for ``course_roles`` has begun.
The major determinant is the progress on the v2 Content Libraries.
