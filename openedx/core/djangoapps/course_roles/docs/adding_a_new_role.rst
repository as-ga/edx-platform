Adding a New CourseRoles Role
#################################

* The initial roles created in the ``CourseRoles`` service **will match** the existing ``StudentCourseAccessRole`` roles.
* These roles will be created with **database migrations** as they should exist in all instances.
* Future roles can be created using a database migration file if they are intended for all instances. 
* Future roles intended for only one instance can currently be created by running SQL.
* If creating new roles is a common use case, it can be added to the django admin dashboard.

Data Model Considerations
*************************

Data will need to be added to the ``Role``, ``RolePermission``, and ``RoleService`` tables.
This will:

* create a role (``Role``)
* grant it access (``RolePermission``)
* determine which UI can be used to assign the role to a user (``RoleService``)

Sample SQL
**********

Role Creation
-------------

The sql to create a **new role** is:

``insert into course_roles_role (name) values ([role_name]);``

* This sql will create a role, but until it is connected to a permission or permissions it will not grant any access.
* This sql will create a role, but until it is connected to a service or services it will not be possible to assign the role to a user in a UI. 

RolePermission Creation
-----------------------

The **list of permissions** to be connected to a role and their ids can be found by running the following sql:

``select * from course_roles_permission;``

The sql to **connect** a **role to** the chosen **permission** is:

``insert into course_roles_rolepermission (role_id, permission_id) values ([role_id], [permission_id]);`` 

RoleService Creation
--------------------

The **list of services** to be connected to a role and their ids can be found by running the following sql:

``select * from course_roles_service;``

The sql to **connect** a **role to** the chosen **service** is:

``insert into course_roles_roleservice (role_id, service_id) values ([role_id], [service_id]);``
